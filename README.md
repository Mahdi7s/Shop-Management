I developed a clean-coded shop management project implemented by WPF, Data-Binding, ADO.Net and MVP architecture in a WPF and MVP (Model-View-Presenter) workshop about 12 years ago.

### Features:
- Categories section: you can create, edit and remove a category
- Customers section: you can create, edit and remove a customer
- Products section: you can create, edit and remove a product
- Sold Product: you can add and update sold products
- Supplier: you can add, update and remove the supplier
